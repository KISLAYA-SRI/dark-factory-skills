## Activate Only On The Declared Operational Trigger

Use the skill only when the user request matches the generated skill description, systems, or domain-specific trigger terms. Do not activate for generic writing, planning, or unrelated tasks.

**Incorrect:**

User asks for an unrelated backend deployment review. The agent applies this skill because it sees a generic word like validation.

**Correct:**

User asks to design frontend architecture, define module boundaries, add micro-frontends/module federation, improve scalability, organize frontend domains, add governance docs/CODEOWNERS/ADRs, or plan migrations/refactors such as Pages to App Router.

## Applies To Modes
- delta_change
- review_judge

## Does Not Apply To Modes
- greenfield_build
- brownfield_change
- debug_fix

## When To Apply
- The user intent matches the generated skill description.
- At least one declared system, role, process stage, or domain keyword is present.

## Does Not Apply To
- The task does not touch this rule boundary.

## Evidence And Validation
- Record the matched trigger phrase or recipe step id.
- If the match is weak, return an elicitation question instead of executing.
